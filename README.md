# Introduction
My name is Linar Jonasson, I'm soon to be 20. I've been hesitating for a long time about what career path to take as I only dreamed of becoming a surgeon until Covid-19 broke it by highlighting the possible stress associated with it. Only this year have I chosen the path to be a Web Developer with an Associate's Degree to reduce total tuition cost and because I have no confidence in becoming a Computer Scientist or Software Developer. I hope this course will improve my ability to analyze codes and turn empty languages into a working program.
